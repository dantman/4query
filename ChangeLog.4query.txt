== 4query ChangeLog ==

=== 0.0.2 ===
- Instead of always falling back to insecure eval, use a json parse if one is available
- Rename .toggle to .toggleVisibility to make the name less ambiguous (keep a depreciated .toggle alias for backwards compat)
- Add .size .innerSize and .outerSize to make the dimensions API follow a similar pattern as the offset API
- .attr and .css now support input in the format of an array of keys to output an object for; this object can later be passed back to reset those keys
- Fix noConflict:deep so it also reverts the $4 symbol
- scrollLeft and scrollTop can accept named aliases for the left and top, and the right and bottom to make scrolling code easier
- Rename :parent to :hasChildren
- Depreciate ambiguous .toggle( fn, fn, fn ); and instead support .click( fn, fn, fn );

=== 0.0.1 ===
- Initial jQuery modifications
- Dropping pack support for now
- Ignoring plugins for now
- Added $4 symbol
- Tracking both jQuery and 4query versions
