4query - Fork branch of jQuery (New Wave Javascript)
http://4query.org/      http://jquery.com
----------------------------------------------------

What you need to build your own 4query:
 - Make sure that you have Java installed.

   If not, go to this page and download "Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0"
   http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

 - As well you will need GNU make.
   Make is pre-installed on most Linux and BSD based distributions
   (This should include OS X) and Windows users can get access to it
   using cygwin.

How to build your own 4query:

In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), type
the following to make all versions of 4query, the documentation, and the test suite:
  make

Here are each of the individual items that are buildable from the Makefile.

make 4query
  The standard, uncompressed, 4query code.
  Makes: ./dist/4query.js

make lite
  4query without all the additional inline documentation and test cases.
  Makes: ./dist/4query.lite.js

make docs
  Builds a complete copy of the documentation, based upon the 4query source.
  Makes ./docs/
  Open this file in your browser:
    ./docs/index.xml

make test
  Builds a complete copy of the test suite, based upon the 4query source.
  Makes ./test/
  Open this file in your browser:
    ./test/index.html

Finally, you can remove all the built files using the command:
  make clean

Additionally, if you want to install 4query to a location that is not this
directory, you can specify the PREFIX directory, for example:
  make PREFIX=/home/john/test/
OR
  make PREFIX=~/www/ docs
