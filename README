jQuery - New Wave Javascript
http://jquery.com/
--------------------------------

How to build your own jQuery:
 - Make sure that you have Java installed.
 - And some common UNIX commands (like 'make', 'mkdir', 'rm', 'cat', and 'echo')

In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), type
the following to make all versions of jQuery, the documentation, and the test suite:
  make

Here are each of the individual items that are buildable from the Makefile.

make jquery
  The standard, uncompressed, jQuery code.
  Makes: ./dist/jquery.js

make lite
  jQuery without all the additional inline documentation and test cases.
  Makes: ./dist/jquery.lite.js

make pack
  A compressed version of jQuery (made with Packer).
  Makes: ./dist/jquery.pack.js

make docs
  Builds a complete copy of the documentation, based upon the jQuery source.
  Makes ./docs/
  Open this file in your browser:
    ./docs/index.xml

make test
  Builds a complete copy of the test suite, based upon the jQuery source.
  Makes ./test/
  Open this file in your browser:
    ./test/index.html

Finally, you can remove all the built files using the command:
  make clean

Additionally, if you want to install jQuery to a location that is not this
directory, you can specify the PREFIX directory, for example:
  make PREFIX=/home/john/test/
OR
  make PREFIX=~/www/ docs

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them on the jQuery
mailing list, which can be found here:
