4query - New Wave Javascript
http://4query.org/
--------------------------------

What you need to build your own 4query:
 - Make sure that you have Java installed.

   If not, go to this page and download "Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0"
   http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

 - You now have two options for building 4query, if you have access to
   common UNIX commands (like 'make', 'mkdir', 'rm', 'cat', and 'echo')
   then simply type 'make' to build all the components.

 - The other option is if you have Ant installed (or are on Windows and
   don't have access to make). You can download Ant from here:
   http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

   If you do have Ant, everytime (in this README) that I say 'make', do
   'ant' instead - it works identically (for all intents and purposes).

How to build your own 4query:

In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), type
the following to make all versions of 4query, the documentation, and the test suite:
  make

Here are each of the individual items that are buildable from the Makefile.

make 4query
  The standard, uncompressed, 4query code.
  Makes: ./dist/4query.js

make lite
  4query without all the additional inline documentation and test cases.
  Makes: ./dist/4query.lite.js

make docs
  Builds a complete copy of the documentation, based upon the 4query source.
  Makes ./docs/
  Open this file in your browser:
    ./docs/index.xml

make test
  Builds a complete copy of the test suite, based upon the 4query source.
  Makes ./test/
  Open this file in your browser:
    ./test/index.html

Finally, you can remove all the built files using the command:
  make clean

Additionally, if you want to install 4query to a location that is not this
directory, you can specify the PREFIX directory, for example:
  make PREFIX=/home/john/test/
OR
  make PREFIX=~/www/ docs
